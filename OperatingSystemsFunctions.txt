Memory management is a primary function of an operating system. Memory management is necessary for computers to operate, it is the brain of the computer. Like its name suggests, it stores information for later use.
A second function is processor management. The Operating System manages processes allocates the processor to a process. The traffic controller is in charge of this function.
Device management is a third but not final function of the operating system. The I/O controller keeps track of devices. It decides which process gets what device and when.
